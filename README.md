# dbt_airflow_snowflake Demo and Sandbox

This repo contains a quick Demo and a Sandbox to run dbt actions on Snowflake using Airflow as orchestrator.


## Objectives

### Demo

The objective of the Demo is to create a basic pipeline on Snowflake using two popular data tools: Airflow, an open-source workflow management platform that can be used to author and manage data pipelines and orchestrations; and dbt, an engineering framework leveraging cloud data platforms like Snowflake. dbt CLI is the command line interface for running dbt projects.

### Sandbox

The objective of the Sandbox is to create a docker containing dbt and Airflow, so tyou can create DAGs and setup dbt as you may want to.



## Requirements
Docker, dbt, Python, conda (optional) and a Snowflake instance.
